# Primitive Recursive Functions

Some OCaml, implementing basic arithmetic operations using primitive recursive definitions.

## Notes

All functions follow primitive recursive form with explicit base cases and recursive definitions that mirror the mathematical definitions of these operations on natural numbers.
